Welcome to the Moss blog! We're excited to have this space to share updates, insights, and stories about building truly peer-to-peer collaboration tools.

## What is Moss?

Moss is a peer-to-peer, privacy-first groupware designed for small teams who want to work together without relying on centralized platforms. Built on Holochain technology, Moss gives groups:

- **True ownership** of their data and communications
- **Customizable tools** that adapt to their specific needs
- **Privacy by design** - no surveillance, no tracking
- **Open source** foundation for transparency and community contribution

## Why We're Building This

We believe people deserve better tools for collective work. Tools that respect privacy, enable true ownership, and put relationships at the center.

The current landscape of collaboration software is dominated by platforms that:

- Extract value from user data
- Lock teams into proprietary ecosystems
- Prioritize growth metrics over user needs
- Can cut off access at any time

Moss offers a different path forward.

## What to Expect on This Blog

This blog will be a place to:

- Share **product updates** and new features
- Explore **ideas about collaboration** and peer-to-peer technology
- Tell **stories from the community** using Moss
- Discuss **technical architecture** for developers interested in building on Holochain
- Announce **events and workshops** for the Moss community
